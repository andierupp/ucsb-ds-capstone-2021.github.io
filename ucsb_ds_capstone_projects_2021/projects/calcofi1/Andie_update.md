In our previous spatial analysis, an open source software called QGIS was used. In an effort to make our work reproducible for most data scientists, the mapping of fish larva vs fish caught was done using geopandas. While these maps do not have the same polished look that is produced by the GIS software, they can be made by anyone with a basic understanding of python. This example image is a map of all CALCOFI stations where larva were found and all the blocks where mature yellowtail fish were caught.

We are also interested if any environmental variables relate to the amount of fish larva or the likelihood of larva becoming adults. To do so, we began looking into CALCOFI hydrographic bottle data. This data consists of physical seawater properties measured from 1949 to present. The main aspects of this data that we focused on were temperature and salinity. This data first had to be processed into a useable form, parsing columns to create new entries for positions and dates. After doing this, the data was subsetted to only contain the lines and stations that were present in the larval data and to discard all properties other than tempeerature and salinity. Cross correlation was then started for the larval data using numpy's correlation coefficient package which returns Pearson product moment correlation coefficients. The only species to be analyzed so far was Opah, which showed a -0.0094 correlation with temperature and a 0.0091 correlation with salinity.
